Work Together Well

<ol>
	<li>Short term goal: Develop an <strong>online course</strong> to help people learn how to be a valued member of a great team.</li>
	<li>Long term goal: Build a better <strong>learning platform</strong> and open it up to other teachers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Key concepts: Capability, Capability Map, Learning Story, Learning Journey</p>

<p>Design principles for our learning platform:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design around CAPABILITIES (defined by mastery criteria). Be explicit and transparent about them.</li>
	<li>Keep the capabilities highly granular to allow for personalisation, incremental learning and insights into the learning process.</li>
	<li>Collect capabilities into a CAPABILITY MAPS to show the big picture. Allow teachers and to craft LEARNING JOURNEYS through the Map.</li>
	<li>Focus on doing to develop and demonstrate MASTERY rather than consuming content on the topic.</li>
	<li>Support a learning process that includes review and reinforcement not just one time learning.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Regular eLearning and typical live workshops suck:</p>
<ul>
	<li>focused on content consumption not developing competencies ~> we help you develop specific competencies</li>
	<li>one time experiences ~> we guide you through a learning journey so that you can internalise key skills</li>
	<li>one size fits all ~> we let you decide which areas to focus on</li>
	<li>poor retention and follow through ~> we translate knowledge into action-oriented mastery criteria</li>
</ul>
